# pokeapi

My first Demo-Project with Flutter. I thought the PokeApi would be a good point to start and learn
Flutter. Work in progress, so everything is a little bit messy.

Also i'm not sure if i'm doing it right (using PokeApi with german localization), this in the first
Step is only for my learning.

# Instructions
Run "flutter pub get" to get the packages that are needed. Then run the Project in the IDE of your
choice.
